            <h5>Don't Use It You Lose it</h5>

            <p>Just like learning a spoken language, you need consistent practice in order to get better and maintain the ability to speak said language. After recieving an Associates degree in computer programming, having learned html and java most of it was lost when it could not be applied on a consistent basis. Real life got in the way and needing to get a job asap, the new found skills went unused for a few years. Now in a transition, and going back to a passion, Pedro is trying to recapture what he once lost, writing code.</p>

            <h5>About Pedro</h5>

            <p>Pedro Oliva resides in South Bend, Indiana with his handsome French Bulldog Chile Con Queso. He has an Associates degree in computer information systems from Ivy Tech Community College. Pedro is a CIW certified Web Associate and has been studying Ruby on Rails development through Launch School formerly known as Tealeaf Academy. </p>

            <h2>Chile Con Queso</h2>
            <h5>Will Code For Treats</h5>

            <p>In between long durations of sleep sometimes you need an extra little motivation to get some work done. Being French, French fries are one of the greatest motivators to get a programmer to code, and Queso knows this all to well. Whether its fries on a special occasion, milkbone minis, or canine carry outs, any sort of treat will get this canine to code.</p>

            <h5>About Queso</h5>

            <p>Chile Con Queso is a one year old French Bulldog. While he certainly enjoys his naps he enjoys his time with his pal Pedro who keep each other company during long coding sessions. Although he has many toys to choose from, his favorite is hard plastic coat hangers.</p>

            <h5>The Business of Play</h5>

            <p>Play isn’t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that – and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience isn’t about those surface elements either – it’s about creating an environment with well-understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you’re trying to encourage people – or yourself – to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game mechanics and play could be the trump card you’re looking for.</p>

            <h5>About Carolyn</h5>

            <p>Carolyn Chandler has been working in the field of User Experience Design for over 14 years. She was an adjunct professor at DePaul University and is the UX Design Instructor at The Starter League, where she first developed her activity-based approach for teaching core design concepts. Carolyn is the co-founder of The School for Digital Craftsmanship and co-author of two books, A Project Guide to UX Design and Adventures in Experience Design.</p>

            <h5>What Designers and Strategists Can Learn from Dick Fosbury</h5>

            <p>Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to the high jump with an unorthodox “back first” technique that became known as the Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him “the world’s laziest high jumper” — but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almost every high jumper.

            We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web, mobile and device interfaces have evolved from systems and processes that no longer connect with our audiences’ realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor to “save” information, push buttons as control devices and typography standards derived from mechanical typesetting.

            As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and to free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions of the future. </p>

            <h5>About Brad</h5>

            <p>Brad Smith is executive director for WebVisions, a conference that explores the future of the web. Most recently he launched “The Institute for Social Good,” an organization that connects non-profits with volunteers willing to spend a day building awesome web and mobile apps to change the world for the better.</p>

            <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>

            <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>

            <h5>About Bermon</h5>

            <p>JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that our code is ready for production? This talk will share tips on how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.</p>

            <h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>

            <p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning – both of code and drum beats! You’ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner’s heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit. </p>
